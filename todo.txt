Occasionally, the PIF thread will erroneously do a DMA when the main CPU thread hasnt even run yet. Maybe unintialized data? (observed, OS X).

Implement a proper GUI for the debugger. The current stuff is outdated tech. IMGUI is the future.

Either the debugger or the entire system doesn't bswap when it's supposed to.

Cleanup massive use of hardcoded values, sigh!

@TODO why are these calling ReadMemWordRaw? You may want to read from memory mapped IO with this mode!

// @TODO detect byte-order swapping for user mode only!
// @TODO is the CPU supposed to support executing instructions
// in reverse endian mode?
